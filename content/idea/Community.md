## Community Outreach
Some future ideas from the Methuselah team.

#### Coin Acquisition
We have discussed the idea of creating a system that would allow for Methuselah to absorb abandoned coins.  This would require the addition of a "super spork" type feature that would allow for the minting of a large sum of coins to be used in swaps.  The general hope is that we can leave a positive experience for all cryptocurrency users.

#### DEX/Atomic Swap
There are many DEXs already but the ability to bypass a 3rd party platform and do direct Atomic Swaps from within the Methuselah wallet is a logical next step.
